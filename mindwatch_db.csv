Mental and behavioural disorders are a major public health problem."
17,"These disorders are fre­
quent in societies and cultures, they cause a great amount of disability and suffering among 
those affected, as well as considerable distress among friends and family members."
18,"Yet while 
all societies extend sympathy and some degree of assistance to those who are physically ill, 
attitudes to the mentally ill all too often include rejection and stigma."
19,"The many millions who suffer mental and behavioural disorders deserve both our respect and 
our assistance."
20,"The World Health Organization has consistently encouraged research into the 
treatment of mentally ill persons and has stressed that approaches to mental ill-health should 
be fundamentally the same as approaches to physical ill-health."
21,"Our knowledge of mental 
illness and its causes is now such that the treatment of mentally ill persons has become routine 
in many parts of the world."
22,"Different disorders can be diagnosed with accuracy and treated 
with reliable and effective methods."
23,"Nevertheless, in many places such treatment is not avail­
able and negative attitudes to the mentally ill still persist."
24,"The World Health Organization is developing a range of clinical tools to assist primary care 
practitioners (even without psychiatric training) and community health workers (even without 
advanced medical training) to deal appropriately with the mentally ill persons with whom they 
come into contact."
25,"The first of those tools is this book - a classification of mental and behav­
ioural disorders that guides diagnosis, advises on counselling, recommends treatment and in­
dicates when referral is likely to be necessary."
26,"It uses the primary care approach which has been 
so successfully used in the treatment of physical ill-health around the world."
27,"The secrecy that attends mental and behavioural disorders frequently conceals the size of the 
problem."
28,"We must be honest enough to face up to mental illness, informed enough to recognize 
it for what it is, and open enough to enlist the help of family and community members in its 
treatment."
29,"Mental illness is, after all, only illness, and in most cases, with the right kind of 
help, it can be overcome."
30,"We owe it to those who have this type of illness to provide the help 
they need before their illness develops to a more serious state."
31,"Foreword Professor large Alberta Costa e Silva

and Prevention of Substance Abuse

iii Preface 
Primary care encompasses both a philosophy of health development as well as a health service 
level."
32,"The philosophy stresses the need for comprehensive coverage of health problems in com­
munities, providing promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services."
33,"At the service 
level this means that primary care should cover all basic aspects of health."
34,"This book has been 
written to ensure that, at the level of service provision, mental health becomes an integral part 
of the primary care practice."
35,Mental disorders are common in the primary care settings.
36,"They are more disabling than many 
chronic and severe diseases; they do not easily get better or limit themselves without treatment."
37,"Although simple, effective and acceptable treatments are available, they are not utilized suffi­
ciently."
38,"There is therefore a need to improve the identification and management of mental 
disorders at the primary care level."
39,Today there is ample scientific evidence that mental disorders are medical illnesses.
40,"Work on 
the criteria for mental disorders has enabled us to define these illnesses with accuracy and 
reliability."
41,"Many mental disorders such as depreSSion, panic disorder and bipolar disorder can 
be treated more effectively than hypertension and coronary heart disease."
42,"This treatment must 
become an integral part of the work of primary care physicians."
43,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a state-of-the-art classification of mental 
disorders for use in clinical practice and research."
44,"The Tenth Revision of the International Classi­
fication of Diseases (lCD-10) has many features that improve the diagnosis of mental disorders."
45,"To extend this development to primary care settings, where most patients with mental disorders 
are seen, diagnostic and management guidelines have been combined in the present book, 
Diagnostic and Management Guidelines for Mental Disorders in Primary Care (lCD-10 Chapter V, 
Primary Care Version), referred to here as ICD-lO PC Chapter V. 
ICD-lO PC Chapter V has been prepared in the light of the experience of primary care physi­
cians and takes into account their needs."
46,"It is short, user-friendly and oriented towards man­
agement."
47,"The book contains essential information on how to help patients with mental disor­
ders."
48,"It gives guidelines for diagnosis in cases where the primary care physician has to do this 
task alone."
49,"It also gives guidelines on what to say to patients and their families, how to give 
them counselling, what medication to prescribe, and when to consult a specialist."
50,"In short 
ICD-lO PC Chapter V presents the knowledge of mental health science in an easily under­
standable form for the practitioner at the primary care leveL 
The primary care version of the mental disorders classification was designed by an international 
group of general practitioners, family physicians, mental health workers, public health experts, 
social workers, psychiatrists and psychologists with a special interest in mental health problems 
in primary care."
51,"Drafts were reviewed by mental health care providers and primary care provid­
ers."
52,"After two rounds of revision, the classification system was field-tested in more than 40 
countries by over 500 primary care physicians to assess its relevance, ease of use and reliability."
53,"This primary care classification system provides a model for national adaptation and allows for 
other changes as appropriate."
54,"WHO is currently developing methods for improving the diag­
nostic assessment of mental disorders (e. g., brief screening tools), as well as educational pro­
grammes for training workers at the primary care level in the fields of mental health and sub­
stance use (e. g., training kits for individual use or group-learning)."
55,"WHO and the network of 
Collaborating Centres that developed the classification system are making efforts to get it dis­
seminated more widely and adapted to local needs in different countries."
56,"These efforts are being 
Preface v accompanied by a research strategy to evaluate whether this classification system actually im­
proves identification and management."
57,"WHO would be pleased to see the primary care version of the mental disorders classification 
become part of all medical curricula, since it sets out precisely what a general practitioner 
should know in diagnosing and treating mental health problems."
58,"WHO is ready to assist users 
in adapting the classification to their national needs, incorporating it into computer systems, 
and improving consultation and assessment."
59,"This book has been prepared as a practical re­
sponse to the need to improve the diagnosis and management of mental disorders by primary 
care physicians."
60,"Continuing efforts are being made to improve this response, and it is hoped 
that users of the book will provide feedback to help in this."
61,"Please send us your comments and 
suggestions to improve rCD-IO primary care version of the mental disorders classification."

Table of Contents vii Introduction 
This primary care version of the mental disorders classification (ICD-IQ PC Chapter V) deals 
with conditions which are frequently seen in primary care and which can be managed effec­
tively by general practitioners."
63,"For each condition, diagnostic and management guidelines are 
given on facing pages."
64,"The management guidelines include information for the patient, advice 
on counselling, descriptions of treatment metbods, and indications for specialist referraL They 
are supported by a set of flow charts to aid diagnostic decision-making."
65,"National adaptations 
of the guidelines may include the production of medication cards for physicians and informa­
tion leaflets for patients."
66,"The primary care version of the classification of mental disorders is 
tailored to the needs of general practitioners worldwide and corresponds to Chapter V of the 
Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-IQ)."
67,"The primary care ver­
sion has been designed to be: 
~ brief and easy to understand 
-user friendly 
- a source of advice on management (including treatment) 
-compatible with ICD-IQ Chapter V 
-reliable for assessment in primary care settings (i. e., so that different users may reach the 
same diagnosis)."
68,Use of the classification in education and training was also regarded as important.
69,"The system 
can be learned easily by primary care personnel in different parts of the world."
70,"The categories 
The book contains a list of categories of mental disorders from the ICD-lO classification."
71,"This is the result of a selection process that reflects: 
the public health importance of disorders (1. e., prevalence, morbidity or mortality, disability 
resulting from the condition, burdens imposed on the family or community, health care 
resources need); 
availability of effective and acceptable management (1. e., interventions with a high prob­
ability of benefit to the patient or her/his family are readily available within primary care 
and are acceptable to the patient and the community); 
-consensus regarding classification and management (i. e., a reasonable consensus exists 
among primary care physicians and psychiatrists regarding the diagnosis and management 
of the condition); 
-cross-cultural applicability (1. e., suggestions for identification and management are applica­
ble in different cultural settings and health care systems); 
-consistency with the main ICD-IQ classification scheme (i. e., each diagnosis and diagnostic 
category corresponds to those in lCD-IQ)."
72,"All diagnoses included in this book are fairly common in primary care settings and a manage­
ment plan can be written for each of them."
73,"The list of categories is standard and is used inter­
nationally, although categories of disorder that are reported infrequently in a particular country 
(such as eating disorders in India or dissociative disorders in the United Kingdom) may be 
omitted from the lists normally used in those places."
74,"The management guidelines may, how-
Introduction 1 ever, vary according to the country, the health care system and the training of health care 
workers."
75,"The guidelines 
The headings for diagnostic information on each category of disorder are: 
-Presenting complaints -problems typically seen in primary care patients (to avoid repetition, 
those presented as diagnostic features are not restated); 
-Diagnostic features -a concise version of ICD-lD diagnostic guidelines; 
-Differential diagnosis -other physical or mental conditions that should be considered when 
making a diagnosis."
76,The management plan that follows each diagnosis can be modified to suit local conditions.
77,"The general headings for the management guidelines are: 
-Essential information for patient and family -general information about the disorder, such as 
its nature or cause; 
-Specific counselling for patient and family -advice and psychotherapeutic strategies concerning 
the particular condition (how to cope, what to do, etc."
78,"); 
-Medication -advice on the use of drugs (how to use, effects, side-effects, ways to increase 
compliance); 
-Specialist consultation -indications on when and how to refer to a specialist."
79,The guidelines contain information that is considered essential for all patients.
80,"In addition, 
leaflets are being prepared to help patients understand the management strategies (e. g., a guide 
to sensible drinking or learning to relax) 
The symptom index and flow charts 
A ""symptom index"" (see pages 92-93) provides different entry points to the classification sys­
tem (e. g., differential diagnostic indexes for key symptoms such as appetite loss, tiredness, 
insomnia, anxiety, fears, inattention, etc.)."
81,"Flow charts (see pages 94-95) that accompany the primary care classification are intended to 
facilitate learning and assist general practitioners in their everyday decision-making."
82,"The flow 
charts show the sequence of diagnostic decisions that a general practitioner makes in the iden­
tification of mental disorders."
83,"In view of the increasing role of computers in primary care settings in some parts of the world, 
WHO is also exploring possibilities of developing a simple computerized system to guide pri­
mary care physicians in making diagnoses."
84,"Two versions of the primary care classification 
There are at least two major groups of primary care practitioners: (1) those with medical training 
and prescription responsibility; (2) others with limited medical training."
85,"Usually these work as 
""primary care teams"" as a desirable way of work."
86,"Therefore, the ICD-lD PC Chapter V contains 
two versions: 
- a concise version (containing 25 conditions) for those with medical training (I), 
- a brief version (containing 6 conditions) for other primary care workers (2)."
87,"2 Introduction Crosswalks to ICD-10 Chapter V 
The lCD-IO PC Chapter V mental disorders classification, primary care version, is a ""user­
friendly"" version of the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-lO) 
Chapter V. For practical reasons, the ICD-lO PC is a condensed version of ICD-lO Chapter V 
for easy application in busy primary care settings."
88,"It has 25 categories instead of 457 in the 
main ICD-lO Chapter V. The ICD-lO PC Chapter V intends to cover the universe of mental 
disorders seen in primary care settings."
89,"As a classification, it is ""jointly exhaustive and mutually 
exclusive""."
90,"It may seem simplistic; however, it corresponds to the lCD-lO main volume."
91,"Ap­
pendix 1 is a crosswalk that shows the ""lumping"" of the detailed specialty-adaptation categories 
into ICD-lO PC categories."
92,"Field trials 
Field trials of the primary care classification of mental disorders were conducted in 40 countries 
with more than 500 primary care physicians."
93,"The field trials assessed the adequacy, ease of use 
and consistency of the classification in different settings and tested the appropriateness of the 
management guidelines in different cultures and health care systems."
94,"Modifications were made 
in the light of this experience, resulting in the present publication."
95,"Acknowledgements 
The primary care classification of mental disorders would not have been possible without the 
advice, support and collaboration of primary care workers, researchers, WHO Collaborating 
Centres and other agenCies."

ICD-IO PC Chapter V uses some selected-usually three character- codes from the main ICD-IO 
volume."
111,The # code is used in ICD-IO PC Chapter V only.
112,"It refers to ""condensed"" codes."
113,"For 
example, FOO# -Dementia refers to all different types of dementias listed in FOO-F03 and their 
related fourth and fifth character codes (see the Crosswalks below)."
114,"F99 is a non-recommended residual category, when no other code from the list can be used."
115,"If there is a more definite diagnosis with ICD-IO Chapter V codes users may wish to retain it 
in full rather than using F99."
116,USO# is to be used during assessment and if there is a diagnosis or coding is deferred.
117,"Categories of mental and behavioural disorders 7 Dementia -FOO# 
I Presenting complaints I 
Patients may complain of forgetfulness or feeling depressed, but may be unaware of memory 
loss."
118,Patients and family may sometimes deny severity of memory loss.
119,"Families ask for help initially because of failing memory, change in personality or behaviour."
120,"In the later stages of the illness they seek help because of confusion, wandering or incontinence."
121,Poor personal hygiene in an older patient may indicate memory loss.
122,"I Diagnostic features I 
-Decline in recent memory, thinking and judgement, orientation, language."
123,"-Patients often appear apathetic or disinterested, but may appear alert and appropriate despite 
poor memory."
124,"-Decline in everyday functioning (dressing, washing, cooking)."
125,"-Loss of emotional control -patients may be easily upset, tearful or irritable."
126,"-Common in older patients, very rare in youth or middle age."
127,"Tests of memory and thinking may include: 
-ability to recall names of three common objects immediately and again after three minutes; 
-ability to name days of week in reverse order."
128,"I Differential diagnosis I 
Examine for other illnesses causing memory loss."
129,"Examples include: 
depression (F32#) 
urinary infection 
subdural haematoma 
other infectious illnesses anaemia 
B12 or folate deficiency 
syphilis 
HIV infection 
normal pressure hydrocephalus 
-Prescribed drugs or alcohol may affect memory and concentration."
130,"-Sudden increases in confusion may indicate a physical illness (e. g., acute infectious illness) 
or toxicity from medication."
131,"If confusion, wandering attention or agitation are present, see 
Delirium -FOS."
132,"-Depression may cause memory and concentration problems similar to those of dementia, 
especially in older patients."
133,"If low or sad mood is prominent, see Depression -F32#."
134,"8 Dementia -FOO# Essential information for patient and family 
Dementia is frequent in old age."
135,"Memory loss and confusion may cause behaviour problems (e. g., agitation, suspiciousness, 
emotional outbursts)."
136,"Memory loss usually proceeds slowly, but course is quite variable."
137,Physical illness or mental stress can increase confusion.
138,-Provide available information and describe community resources.
139,"I Counselling of patient and family I 
Monitor the patient's ability to perform daily tasks safely."
140,"If memory loss is mild, consider use of memory aids or reminders."
141,Avoid placing patient in unfamiliar places or situations.
142,"Consider ways to reduce stress on those caring for the patient (e. g., self-help groups)."
143,"Support 
from other families caring for relatives with dementia may be helpful."
144,Discuss planning of legal and financial affairs.
145,"As appropriate, discuss arrangements for support in the home, community or day care pro­
grammes, or residential placement."
146,Uncontrollable agitation may require admission to a hospital or nursing home.
147,"I Medication I 
Use sedative or hypnotic medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) cautiously; they may in­
crease confusion."
148,"Antipsychotic medication in low doses (e. g., haloperidol 0.S-1.0 mg once or twice a day) 
may sometimes be needed to control agitation, psychotic symptoms or aggression."
149,"Beware 
of drug side-effects (Parkinsonian symptoms, anticholinergic effects) and drug interactions."
150,"Specialist consultation I 
Consider consultation for: 
uncontrollable agitation 
sudden onset or worsening of memory loss 
physical causes of dementia requiring specialist treatment (e. g., syphilis, subdural haema­
toma)."
151,Consider placement in a hospital or nursing home if intensive care is needed.
152,"Dementia -FOO# 9 Delirium -F05 
I Presenting complaints I 
-Families may request help because patient is confused or agitated."
153,-Delirium may occur in patients hospitalized for physical conditions.
154,-Patients may appear uncooperative or fearful.
155,"I Diagnostic features I 
Acute onset of: 
-confusion (patient appears confused, struggles to understand surroundings) 
-clouded thinking or awareness."
156,"Often accompanied by: 
Poor memory 
emotional upset 
wandering attention 
withdrawal from others 
suspiciousness agitation 
loss of orientation 
hearing voices 
visions or illusions 
disturbed sleep 
(reversal of sleep pattern) 
Symptoms often develop rapidly and may change from hour to hour."
157,May occur in patients with previously normal mental function or in those with dementia.
158,"Milder stresses (medication, mild infections) may cause delirium in older patients or in those 
with dementia."
159,"I Differential diagnosis I 
Identify and correct possible physical causes of confusion, such as: 
-alcohol intoxication or withdrawal 
drug intoxication or withdrawal (including prescribed drugs) 
severe infections 
metabolic changes (e. g., liver disease, dehydration, hypoglycaemia) 
head trauma 
hypoxia 
If symptoms persists, delusions and disordered thinking predominate, and no physical cause 
is identified, see Acute psychotic disorders -F23."
160,"10 Delirium -FOS Essential information for patient and family 
-Strange behaviour or speech are symptoms of an illness."
161,"I Counselling of patient and family I 
-Take measures to prevent the patient from harming him/herself or others (e. g., remove 
unsafe objects, restrain if necessary)."
162,-Supportive contact with familiar people can reduce confusion.
163,-Provide frequent reminders of time and place to reduce confusion.
164,"-Hospitalization may be required because of agitation or because of physical illness which is 
cau ing delirium."
165,"l Mec ication I 
-Avcid use of sedative or hypnotic medications (e. g., benzodiazepines) except for the treat­
me t of alcohol or sedative withdrawal."

-depressed mood 
-nervousness 
-insomnia 
-physical complications of alcohol use (ulcer, gastritis, liver disease) 
-accidents or injuries due to alcohol use 
-poor memory or concentration 
There may also be: 
-legal and social problems due to alcohol use (marital problems, missed work) 
-signs of alcohol withdrawal (sweating, tremors, morning sickness, hallucinations)."
170,Patients may sometimes deny or be unaware of alcohol problems.
171,"Family may request help 
before patient does (e. g., because patient is irritable at home, missing work)."

• encourage resumption of normal activities after symptoms improve."
918,"-Avoid confrontation or criticism unless necessary to prevent harmful or disruptive behav­
iour."
919,Unreasonably high expectations by patients or others may be harmful.
920,"However, patients 
should be allowed to function at the highest level of their ability in work or other daily 
activities."
921,"I Medication 
Antipsychotic medication will reduce agitation, hallucinations and delusions (e. g., halop­
eridol2-S mg up to three times a day or chlorpromazine 100--200mg up to three times a day)."
922,"The dose should be the lowest possible for the relief of symptoms, though some patients may 
require higher doses."
923,"Continue antipsychotic medication for at least three months after symptoms resolve (longer 
in the case of a recurrent episode)."
924,"If available, injectable long-acting antipsychotic medication may ensure continuity of treat­
ment and reduce risk of relapse."
925,Inform patient and family of potential side-effects.
926,"Common motor side-effects include: 
-acute dystonias or spasms that can be managed with injectable benzodiazepines or antipark­
insonian drugs 
akathisia (severe motor restlessness) that can be managed with dosage reduction or beta­
blockers 
-Parkinsonian symptoms (tremor, akineSia) that can be managed with oral antiparkinsonian 
drugs (e. g., biperiden 1 mg up to three times a day)."
927,"I Specialist consultation I 
If facilities exist, seek consultation for all new cases of psychotic disorder."
928,Depression or mania with psychotic symptoms may need other treatment.
929,"If pOSSible, seek 
consultation to clarify diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment."
930,"Consultation with appropriate community services may reduce family burden and improve 
rehabilitation."
931,Also seek consultation in cases of severe motor side-effects.
932,"F2$ -Psychotic disorders 69 F3$ -Depression 
I Presenting complaints I 
The patient may present initially with one or more physical symptoms (fatigue, headache, 
pain)."
933,Further enquiry will reveal depression or loss of interest.
934,Irritability is sometimes the presenting problem.
935,May present after suicide attempt.
936,"Some groups are at higher risk (e. g., those who have recently given birth or had a stroke, those 
with Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis)."
937,"I Diagnostic features I 
Low or sad mood."

change in weight) 
suicidal thoughts or acts 
decreased libido 
agitation or slowing of activity."
940,Symptoms of anxiety or nervousness are also frequently present.
941,"I Differential diagnosis I 
Some medications may produce symptoms of depression (e. g., beta-blockers, other antihyper­
tensives, H2 blockers, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids)."
942,"If hallucinations (hearing voices, seeing visions) or delusions (strange or unusual beliefs) are 
present, see also Psychotic disorders for management of these problems."

947,"70 F3$ -Depression Essential information for patient and family 
-Depression is common and effective treatments are available."
948,-Depression is not weakness or laziness; patients are trying hard to cope.
949,"Counselling of patient and family I 
Ask about risk of suicide and risk of harm to others."
950,"Has the patient often thought of 
death or dying?"
951,Does the patient have a specific suicide plan?
952,"Has he/she made serious sui­
cide attempts in the past?"
953,Can the patient be sure not to act on suicidal ideas?
954,"Close super­
vision by family or friends, or hospitalization, may be needed."
955,-Plan short-term activities which give the patient enjoyment or build confidence.
956,"Encourage the patient to resist pessimism and self-criticism, not to act on pessimistic 
ideas (e.g., ending marriage, leaving job), and not to concentrate on negative or guilty 
thoughts."
957,-Identify current life problems or social stresses.
958,"Focus on small, specific steps patients might 
take towards managing these problems."
959,"-If physical symptoms are present, discuss link between physical symptoms and mood (see 
Unexplained somatic complaints F5$)."
960,"After improvement, discuss action to be taken if signs of relapse occur."
961,"Medication I 
Consider antidepressant drugs if sad mood or loss of interest are prominent for at least 
two weeks and four or more of these symptoms are present: 
fatigue or loss of energy disturbed sleep 
guilt or self-reproach poor concentration 
thoughts of death or suicide disturbed appetite 
agitation or slowing of 
movement and speech."
962,"In severe cases, consider medication at the first visit."
963,"In moderate cases, consider medication 
if counselling is not sufficiently helpful."
964,"Build up to the effective dose (e. g., imipramine starting at 25-50 mg each night and increasing 
to 100-150mg by 10 days)."
965,"Lower doses should be given if the patient is older or physically 
ill."
966,"Explain to patient that the medication must be taken every day, that improvement will build 
up over two to three weeks, and that mild side-effects may occur but usually fade in 7-10 days."
967,Advise the patient always to check with health care worker before stopping the medicatin.
968,Continue antidepressant medication for at least 3 months after the condition improves.

Consider consultation if the patient shows significant risk of harm to self or others, or if psy­
chotic symptoms are present."
970,"If significant depression persists, consider consultation about other therapies."
971,"More intensive 
psychotherapies (e. g., cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy) may be useful for treatment 
of acute cases and prevention of relapse."
972,"F3$ -Depression 71 F4$ -Anxiety disorders 
The patient may present initially with tension-related physical symptoms (e. g., headache, 
pounding heart)."
973,Enquiry will reveal prominent anxiety.
974,"~gnostic fea~ 
Fear, anxiety or worry (exaggerated worry, inability to relax), often accompanied by: 
poor concentration fast or pounding heart 
restlessness headaches 
tremors 
dizziness churning stomach or nausea 
sweating."
975,Disorders may occur as sudden attacks of anxiety or fear.
976,Some patients may have extreme fear of specific situations.

If low or sad mood is prominent, see Depression -F3$."
980,"If heavy alcohol or drug use is present, see Alcohol and drug disorders -Fl$."
981,"72 F4$ -Anxiety disorders Essential information for patient and family 
Stress and worry have both physical and mental effects."
982,"Learning skills to reduce the effects of stress (not sedative medication) is the most effective 
relief."
983,Anxiety often produces frightening physical symptoms.
984,"Chest pain, dizziness, or short­
ness of breath are not necessarily signs of a physical illness."
985,"Avoiding feared situations allows the fear to grow stronger; confronting these situations will 
reduce the fear."
986,"Encourage the patient to practise relaxation methods (such as slow, relaxed breathing) to 
reduce physical symptoms of anxiety."
987,"Identify exaggerated fears which occur with anxiety (e. g., patient feels a pounding heart and 
fears he/she is having a heart attack)."
988,"Discuss ways to challenge these fears when they occur (e.g., patient reminds him/herself, 
""l am not having a heart attack."
989,"This is a panic attack, and it will pass in a few minutes"")."
990,"For phobias (anxiety related to specific situations), plan a series of steps to enable tbe pa­
tient to confront and get used to feared situations."
991,"For example: 
1) Identify a small first step towards the feared situation (e. g., take a short walk away from home 
with a family member)."
992,2) This step should be practised over and over until it is no longer frightening.
993,"3) If the feared situation still causes anxiety, the patient should not leave the situation until the fear 
subsides (this will always occur after a few minutes)."
994,"4) Move on to a slightly more difficult step and repeat the procedure (e.g., spend a longer time 
away from home)."
995,5) Do not use alcohol or drugs to help cope with feared situations.
996,-Identify current life problems or social stresses.
997,"Focus on small, specific steps patients might 
take towards managing these problems."
998,-Regular exercise is often helpful.
999,"I Medication I 
With the above counselling, many patients will be able to deal ~ith anxiety without medica­
tion."
1000,"If panic attacks are frequent or if the patient is also depressed, antidepressants may be helpful 
(e.g., imipramine 2Smg at night increasing to 7S-100mg at night after two weeks)."
1001,"For patients with more severe anxiety, short-term use of antianxiety medication may be helpful 
(e. g., lorazepam 0.5 mg up to three times a day)."
1002,"Regular use may lead to dependence with 
symptoms returning when the medication is discontinued."
1003,"I Specialist consultation I 
Avoid unnecessary tests or medications."
1004,Consultation may be helpful if severe anxiety lasts longer than three months.
1005,"F4$ -Anxiety disorders 73 F5$ -Unexplained somatic complaints 
Any physical symptom may be present."
1006,Symptoms may vary widely across cultures.
1007,"Complaints may be single or multiple, and may change over time."
1008,"Various physical complaints without a physical explanation (a full history and physical 
examination are necessary to determine this)."
1009,Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common.
1010,"In acute cases, patients may have: 
dramatic presentations with exaggerated, attention-seeking behaviour 
unusual symptoms not consistent with known disease 
symptoms that vary from minute to minute 
symptoms that may be related to attention from others 
In chronic cases, patients may: 
visit health services repeatedly although medical examinations show no physical problem 
seek only relief from symptoms 
be convinced of the presence of physical illness and unable to believe that no medical con­
dition is present (hypochondriasis)."
1011,"Differential diagnosis I 
If low or sad mood is prominent, see Depression -F3$."
1012,"If strange physical symptoms are present (e. g., belief that organs are decaying) see Psychotic 
disorders."
1013,"If anxiety symptoms are prominent, see Anxiety disorders -F4$."
1014,"74 F5$ -Unexplained somatic complaints Essential information for patient and family 
Stress often produces physical symptoms."
1015,"The focus should be on managing the symptoms, not on discovering their cause."
1016,"Cure may not be possible; the goal should be to live the best life possible even if symptoms 
continue."
1017,"Counselling of patient and family I 
-Acknowledge that the patient's physical symptoms are real."
1018,"They are not lies or inven­
tions."
1019,-Reinforce improvement in the patient.
1020,Try not to reinforce symptoms.
1021,-Ask the patient what he/she thinks is causing the symptoms.

ance (e. g., abdominal pain does not indicate cancer)."
1023,"Advise patients not to focus on medical 
worries."
1024,-Discuss emotional stresses that were present when the symptoms began.
1025,"-Relaxation methods can help relieve symptoms related to tension (headache, neck or back 
pain)."
1026,-Acute cases may need brief rest and relief from stress.
1027,"After the acute period, encourage 
exercise and enjoyable activities."
1028,"The patient need not wait until all symptoms are gone 
before returning to normal routines."
1029,"-For patients with more chronic complaints, regular time-limited appointments with the 
same doctor may prevent more frequent urgent visits."
1030,"I Medication I 
Avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing or prescription of new medication for each new symp­
tom."
1031,"Antidepressant medication (e.g., imipramine 2S-7Smg a day) may be helpful in some cases 
(e. g., headache, irritable bowel syndrome, atypical chest pain)."
1032,"I Specialist consultation I 
Avoid referrals to specialists."
1033,Patients are best managed by one primary health care physician.

Translations and adaptation 
to national standards 
The primary health care classification of mental and behavioural disorders is intended as a 
model system that will assist the identification and management of these disorders in primary 
health care settings."
1064,"While diagnostic guidelines may be consistent across different health care 
systems, patients' presenting complaints and management guidelines may require adaptation 
to meet the needs of users in different countries."
1065,"Diagnostic and management guidelines may 
be adapted to reflect different health service situations, especially in view of the following 
variations: 
-presentation of mental disorders across cultures 
-prevalence of physical disorders which may produce mental symptoms 
practice of primary health care 
availability of specialist treatments."
1066,"Persons and organizations who wish to undertake the translation, adaptation or any other 
application of this book should contact WHO's Division of Mental Health for permission and 
consultation."
1067,"This procedure is required for coordination of translation rights and granting of 
copyright clearance, and will help avoid duplication of effort."
1068,"Sample copies of adaptations 
should be sent to WHO."
1069,"Similar to the initial production of lCD-l 0 PC Chapter v., which encompassed various sources, 
it is recommended that national adaptations should be carried out by (or in consultation with) 
the following: 
-organizations of general practitioners and family physicians (e. g., relevant bodies of the 
national medical association) 
-organizations of psychiatrists (e. g., relevant bodies of the national psychiatric association) 
relevant government agencies (e.g., Ministry of Health) 
WHO and its Collaborating Centres."
